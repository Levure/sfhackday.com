        <h1>Symfony Hackday</h1>

        <p>
            The Symfony hackday is a day were we gather in the same room and contribute to open source code.
            Everybody is welcome. It does not matter if you been contributing before or if you consider yourself
            being an expert in open source software.
        </p>

        <p>
            Next Symfony hackday is <b>Saturday 2019-11-23</b> in Amsterdam after <a href="https://amsterdam2019.symfony.com">Symfony Con</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>What should we do?</h2>
        <p>
            The short anwser is: Whatever you want.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you dont have any ideas yourself, there are plenty of issues you can pick from. We've composed a long list
            in <b><a href="javascript:void(0)">this spreadsheet</a></b>. When you starting with a task,
            please mark it as claimed so no two persons are working on the same thing without knowing.
        </p>

        <p>
            The main focus will be to make library ready for Symfony 5.0. Most of the time it is just to update
            <i>composer.json</i> but you need to carefully read the changelog of the symfony components used to make
            sure we are not breaking anything. (Or, ignore the changelog and hope the library/bundle is tested.)
        </p>

        <p>
            There will also be "theme tables" where people get together to work on a specific component or library.
            There will be a Messenger table, Webpack, PHPUnit, API Platform and some more.
        </p>


        <h2>Make it count</h2>
        <p>
            Whenever you make a PR or Issue on Github, please add <b>#SyfmonyHackday</b> in the description. Then we
            can count the contribution.
        </p>


        <h2>Schedule</h2>

        <p>
            We open the doors around 09.30. Bring your computer or notepad to start coding, helping other or discussing
            issues. At <b>11.00</b> we will start a workshop titled "How do start contributing to open source".
        </p>
        <p>
            We will continue contributing until around 17.00. Nobody is expected to participate in the hackday for the
            full day. You may come and go as you please.
        </p>
